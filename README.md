# LabyrintRpg
A game to be played through a console with ANSI character support.

* It's just a prototype of a simple rpg game i wisk to create.
For now, all you can do is just walking through a real-time-generated
labyrinth. Every new room you enter is generated *on-the-fly*.

* If you find any room with only 1 door (from where you entered),
there's were is supposed to be treasures when the game get improved.

* You can use [A, S, D, W] or ARROW-KEYS to move, and [R] for reset the map.

*DON'T RUN this game through an IDE or it will probably freeze,
due the constant call of the ANSI code that move the text cursor
on the screen, which are not supported by IDE consoles.*

*For better experience, you must maximize the console window before pressing
any key to start the game (The game will even say it when you run it)*
